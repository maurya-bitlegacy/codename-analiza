##TASK
Select one of the compiler infrastructure mentioned below (GCC, LVM, SOOT), and

* Download the source for the infrastructure. 
* Build it

For example, Suppose you plan to use GCC
* Go to the webpage of GCC (see GCC in the the list below)
* Follow the instructions to download the source code.
* Follow the instructions to build GCC. Typically the instructions in in README file or INSTALL file.
